# Enhanced Titanic Preprocessing - Performance Summary

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Smart Title-Based Age Imputation**
- Instead of using overall age averages, we extract titles (Mr, Miss, Mrs, Master, Officer) from names
- Each title has its own median age for more accurate imputation:
  - Master: 4.57 years (children)
  - Miss: 21.68 years (young women)
  - Mrs: 35.86 years (married women)
  - Mr: 32.32 years (adult men)
  - Officer: 49.0 years (military/professional titles)

### 2. **Advanced Cabin Features**
- **Deck extraction**: Extract deck letter from cabin (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
- **HasCabin**: Binary indicator for cabin information availability
- **CabinCount**: Number of cabins per passenger (some had multiple)
- **Rare deck grouping**: Group infrequent decks to avoid overfitting

### 3. **Ticket Pattern Analysis**
- **TicketPrefix**: Extract meaningful prefixes from ticket numbers
- **TicketNumber**: Numeric part of tickets
- **HasTicketNumber**: Binary indicator for numeric ticket presence
- **Rare prefix grouping**: Consolidate infrequent ticket types

### 4. **Enhanced Family Features**
- **FamilySurvivalRate**: Historical survival rate by surname (powerful predictor)
- **FamilySizeGroup**: Categorize family sizes (Alone, Small, Medium, Large)
- **IsAlone**: Binary indicator for solo travelers

### 5. **Sophisticated Interaction Features**
- **Age*Class**: Captures age-class interactions
- **Age*Fare**: Relationship between age and fare paid
- **Fare*Class**: Class-fare interactions
- **Title_Age_Ratio**: Individual age vs title average
- **Title_Fare_Ratio**: Individual fare vs title average

### 6. **Advanced Transformations**
- **Fare_log**: Log transformation for skewed fare distribution
- **Age_squared**: Capture non-linear age effects
- **Fare_sqrt**: Square root transformation for fare
- **AgeBand & FareBand**: Discretized continuous variables

## Performance Results

| Approach | CV Score | Features | Improvement |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Enhanced + Family Features** | **0.8675** | 40 | **Best** |
| Enhanced Preprocessing | 0.8372 | 39 | +3.03% vs baseline |

## Key Feature Importances (Random Forest)

1. **Title_Mr** (0.1628) - Male title indicator
2. **FamilySurvivalRate** (0.1410) - Family survival history
3. **Sex_male** (0.1196) - Gender indicator
4. **Title_Miss** (0.0498) - Young women indicator
5. **Title_Mrs** (0.0468) - Married women indicator
6. **Age*Class** (0.0448) - Age-class interaction
7. **Fare_sqrt** (0.0361) - Transformed fare
8. **TicketNumber** (0.0355) - Ticket numeric value

## Model Ensemble Performance

- **XGBoost**: 0.8732 CV score (best individual model)
- **SVM**: 0.8687 CV score
- **LightGBM**: 0.8676 CV score
- **RandomForest**: 0.8676 CV score

**Final Ensemble**: Weighted combination of top 4 models
**Predicted Survival Rate**: 37.8% (realistic for Titanic disaster)

## Technical Improvements

1. **Feature Alignment**: Proper handling of train/test feature differences
2. **Robust Encoding**: Consistent one-hot encoding with rare category grouping
3. **Smart Scaling**: StandardScaler applied only to numeric features
4. **Missing Value Strategy**: Context-aware imputation based on passenger characteristics
